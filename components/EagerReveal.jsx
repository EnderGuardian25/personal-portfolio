// Above-the-fold entrance that never hides content from the first paint: the
// server HTML renders children fully visible — so the text paints (and LCP is
// recorded) before hydration — then the entrance replays once hydrated. Use
// INSTEAD OF Reveal/motion `initial` for anything visible at the top of a
// page; keep Reveal for below-the-fold sections, where the hidden SSR state
// costs nothing and avoids the replay. Reduced motion: content stays visible,
// no replay.
//
// The same DOM node is kept for the whole lifecycle (initial={false} +
// controls.set) — swapping a plain tag for a motion tag after mount would
// remount the element, and the remounted node's late fade-in paint becomes a
// NEW, larger LCP candidate (webfont vs fallback metrics), pushing LCP right
// back to where it was. Don't "simplify" this into a conditional render.
// replay={false} renders the children as a plain static tag — no entrance at
// all. Use it for the LCP element itself (the largest above-fold text block):
// re-hiding it mid-load lets the webfont swap happen while it's invisible, and
// the reveal paint then re-registers LCP at the animation's end. Everything
// around it can still replay.
